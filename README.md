# Global-Happiness-Analysis-Insights-Predictions
**Exploring Global Happiness Trends Using Data Science**

**Overview**  
This project harnesses advanced data science techniques to delve into the World Happiness Index, examining well-being trends across the globe from 2005 to 2023. By analyzing the complex relationships between economic, social, and health factors, the initiative offers a nuanced understanding of the drivers behind global happiness. Additionally, machine learning models are employed to predict future happiness scores, equipping policymakers and researchers with actionable insights to enhance well-being strategies.

**Key Objectives**  
- **Comprehensive Trend Analysis:** Conduct an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in happiness across 165 countries, uncovering patterns over nearly two decades.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop robust predictive models to estimate happiness scores based on key variables such as GDP, health metrics, and social support systems.
- **Correlation Exploration:** Examine the relationships between happiness scores and influencing factors—including freedom of choice, perceptions of corruption, and other socio-economic indicators—to better understand their impacts.
- **Actionable Insights:** Generate clear, data-driven recommendations aimed at improving global well-being metrics and informing policy decisions.

**Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
   - **Data Sourcing:** Data was gathered from the World Happiness Report, spanning the years 2005 to 2023, ensuring a comprehensive dataset that reflects long-term trends.  
   - **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was rigorously cleaned by removing duplicates, handling missing values through country-specific averages, and standardizing data formats. This meticulous process was essential to maintain data integrity for accurate analysis.
2. **Analysis and Modeling:**  
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The initial analysis involved creating visualizations and statistical summaries to detect underlying trends and patterns in the data. This phase provided insights into the distribution and variability of happiness scores across different regions and time periods.  
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Statistical methods were applied to assess the strength and direction of relationships between happiness scores and variables such as GDP, health, social support, and corruption. This helped pinpoint which factors have the most significant impact on global happiness.  
   - **Predictive Modeling:** Regression techniques, including both Simple Linear Regression and more advanced Random Forest models, were employed to forecast happiness scores. Notably, the Random Forest model achieved an R-squared value of 0.878, demonstrating its strong predictive capabilities.
3. **Tools and Techniques:**  
   - **Programming Environment:** Python was the primary language, utilizing libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning.  
   - **Visualization Strategies:** A combination of interactive and static visualizations was created to clearly present the trends and relationships found in the data, facilitating a better understanding of complex patterns.

**Features**  
- **In-depth Analytical Insights:** The project provides a holistic view of how various factors—economic, social, and health—interact to influence happiness levels worldwide.  
- **Scenario-Based Analysis:** By exploring different scenarios, the study highlights critical relationships, such as the inverse correlation between happiness and perceptions of corruption, offering deeper insights into potential areas for policy intervention.  
- **Predictive Power:** With machine learning models, the project not only explains past trends but also forecasts future happiness scores, allowing stakeholders to anticipate changes and adapt strategies accordingly.  
- **Rich Visual Representations:** The diverse range of visualizations, including interactive dashboards and detailed plots, makes the complex data accessible and actionable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

**Team Contributions**  
A diverse, multidisciplinary team drove this project, combining expertise in data science, statistics, economics, and policy analysis. Each member contributed unique skills—from data cleaning and statistical analysis to machine learning model development and visualization—ensuring a comprehensive and robust analysis of global happiness trends.

**Conclusion**  
This project underscores the pivotal role of data-driven analysis in understanding and predicting global happiness. The integration of rigorous statistical methods with advanced machine learning has produced a dynamic tool capable of not only revealing past trends but also forecasting future well-being. The insights derived from this study are invaluable for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders aiming to enhance quality of life on a global scale. By identifying the key drivers of happiness, the project lays the groundwork for targeted strategies that can foster improved well-being and more sustainable social and economic policies.
